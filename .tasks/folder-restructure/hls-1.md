# Part 1 — HLS: Source Tree Re-Architecture (Stages 0–7)

## Goal

Restructure the codebase under `src/` into clear root folders (`server`, `client`, `ui`, `infra`) **without breaking the app**, using staged moves with verification after every stage. Additionally, identify and migrate “app code” that accidentally lives outside `src/`.

## Non-Goals

- No feature changes.
- No large internal rewrites (no “clean architecture” refactor).
- No attempt to replace Next.js routing conventions (we keep `src/app` as-is).
- No monorepo, no shared package introduction.

---

## Current Reality (from the provided `src` tree)

- Next App Router exists under `src/app/**` (must remain there).
- Payload-related code exists in multiple places (`collections`, `fields`, `access`, `hooks`, `migrations`, plus `src/app/(payload)` routes).
- UI is concentrated under `src/components/**` (including chat, ExerciseRenderer, Media, admin components).
- Infrastructure-ish code exists under `src/utilities/**` and parts of `src/lib/**`.

---

## Target Structure (under `src/`)

> Note: `infra` is a root folder, not under client.

```text
src/
  app/                       # Next.js App Router (kept in place)

  server/
    payload/                 # Payload “framework layer” (config/collections/hooks/access/etc.)
    services/                # server-only use-cases (orchestration + decisions)
    repos/                   # server-only data access/adapters (Payload/DB/HTTP)

  client/
    hooks/                   # client-only hooks (smart)
    state/                   # client state (store, cache, localStorage wrappers)
    api/                     # client fetchers / typed clients / request helpers

  ui/
    web/                     # student learning system UI
    admin/                   # admin UI additions (Payload admin helpers)

  infra/
    logging/
    config/
    llm/
```

---

## Naming Convention (Hard Rule)

All folder names are lowercase:

- `ui/web` (not `ui/Web`)
- `infra/llm` (not `infra/Llm`)

---

## Dependency Boundaries (Design Rules)

Hard boundaries:

- `ui/**` must NOT import from `server/**`
- `client/**` must NOT import from `server/**`
- `server/**` must NOT import from `client/**` or `ui/**`
- `infra/**` must NOT import from `client/**` or `ui/**`

Explicit infra/server rule (added):

- `server -> infra` is allowed
- `infra -> server` is forbidden (infra should remain a leaf)

`src/app/**` is the integration/composition layer and may import from:

- `server/**` for route handlers / server actions
- `client/**` for client-side helpers (sparingly)
- `ui/**` for presentation
- `infra/**` for config/logging wrappers (read-only)

Temporary exceptions during migration are allowed, but:

- must be tracked explicitly
- must be removed before the final enforcement stage (Part 2)

---

## Strategy

A staged migration with a strict verify gate after each stage:

- Move in small batches
- Fix imports immediately
- Run verification commands after each batch
- Only then proceed

---

## Agent Operating Rules (Hard Stop + Operator Approval)

After completing EACH stage:

1. Run the Verification Gate
2. Produce a “Stage Report”:
   - what moved (explicit list)
   - what imports changed (high level)
   - smoke checks performed and outcomes
   - any temporary exceptions introduced (must be listed)

3. **STOP**
4. Ask for explicit operator approval to continue:
   - “Approve Stage X to proceed”

The agent must NOT continue without explicit approval.

---

## Verification Gate (Run after EVERY stage)

Mandatory:

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck` (or `tsc --noEmit`)
- `pnpm test` (if exists)
- `pnpm build` (critical for Next.js)

Smoke checks (2–4 depending on changes):

- Load `/login`
- Load a student page (main course/study flow entry)
- Load Payload admin `/admin`
- Hit critical endpoints:
  - `/api/health`
  - `/api/pdfjs-viewer` (if relevant)
  - plus any endpoint touched in that stage

---

## Repo-Wide Hygiene Guardrails (Added)

These prevent “never-ending refactor”:

- No mass “beautify” changes (keep diffs move-focused)
- Avoid adding new barrel exports during migration (`index.ts` minimal)
- Every stage must include:
  - “No old-path references” check (grep-style)
  - a numeric DoD threshold (below)

---

# Stages 0–7

## Stage 0 — Baseline & Safety Net

**Objective:** Freeze a known-good state and create a single verify script/command.

Actions:

- Add or confirm a single command `pnpm verify` that runs:
  - lint
  - typecheck
  - tests (if exist)
  - build

- Document smoke checks (exact URLs + expected outcomes)

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- `pnpm verify` passes (0 failures)
- Smoke checks doc exists with:
  - at least 3 URLs
  - “expected result” per URL

- No uncommitted changes beyond Stage 0 artifacts

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Stage 1 — Repo Hygiene: move “app code” outside `src/` into `src/`

**Objective:** Identify TS/JS/React code outside `src/` that belongs to the app (not config), and move it into `src/`.

Known scope note (from your plan):

- only `messages` folder

Actions:

- Move the folder(s) under `src/` into an appropriate root (likely `src/infra/config` or `src/server/...` depending on usage)
- Update all imports

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- 0 TS/JS/React “app code” folders remain outside `src/` (excluding build/config)
- 0 import references to the old location (grep)
- `pnpm verify` passes

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Stage 2 — Create Root Folders & Aliases (no big moves yet)

**Objective:** Create `src/server`, `src/client`, `src/ui`, `src/infra` with minimal content and add path aliases.

Actions:

- Create folders:
  - `src/server`, `src/client`, `src/ui`, `src/infra`

- Add TypeScript path aliases:
  - `@/server/*`
  - `@/client/*`
  - `@/ui/*`
  - `@/infra/*`

- Ensure Next/TS tooling resolves them properly

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- Aliases resolve successfully in typecheck (no “cannot find module”)
- No runtime changes (only structural)
- `pnpm verify` passes

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Stage 3 — Migrate Infra First (low-risk wins)

**Objective:** Move infrastructure utilities into `src/infra`.

Move candidates (from your plan):

- `src/utilities/logger` → `src/infra/logging`
- `src/utilities/validation` → `src/infra/config` (or `src/infra/validation`)
- Any “global config” helpers → `src/infra/config`
- LLM wiring:
  - move only infra-level wrappers to `src/infra/llm`
  - providers may remain under existing locations (e.g. `src/lib/ai`) until later (Part 2 if needed)

Rules:

- Prefer updating imports to aliases (`@/infra/...`)
- `infra` must not import from `client` or `ui`
- `infra -> server` forbidden

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- 0 imports still pointing to `src/utilities/logger` and `src/utilities/validation` old paths
- `pnpm verify` passes
- Smoke: app boots + one core route loads

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Stage 4 — Consolidate Payload into `src/server/payload`

**Objective:** Place Payload framework code under one subtree.

Move candidates (from your plan):

- `src/collections` → `src/server/payload/collections`
- `src/fields` → `src/server/payload/fields`
- `src/access` → `src/server/payload/access`
- `src/hooks` → `src/server/payload/hooks`
- `src/migrations` → `src/server/payload/migrations`
- `src/plugins` → `src/server/payload/plugins`

Important:

- `src/app/(payload)` remains in `src/app` (routing), but imports from `src/server/payload`

Rules:

- Use `@/server/...` aliases where possible
- Ensure admin compilation still works

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- 0 imports referencing moved Payload folders at old paths
- `/admin` loads successfully
- `pnpm verify` passes

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Stage 5 — Thin App Layer (Next.js App as Composition Only)

**Goal:** Turn `src/app/**` into a thin composition layer only: routing + minimal orchestration.

### Definition of Done (Target State)

Inside `src/app/**` you will find ONLY:

1. routing (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`)
2. params parsing (`params`, `searchParams`)
3. thin calls to:
   - `src/server/services/**`
   - `src/client/**` (sparingly)

4. passing data to `src/ui/**`

You will NOT find:

- Payload queries / DB access
- permission logic
- transforms and heavy orchestration logic
- LLM logic
- PDF logic
- analytics adapters

If it makes a decision → it does NOT belong in `app`.

### Allowed Imports from `src/app/**`

- `@/server/services/*`
- `@/server/repos/*` (only via services, preferred)
- `@/ui/*`
- `@/client/*` (sparingly)
- `@/infra/*` (read-only config if needed)

### Forbidden in `src/app/**`

- direct Payload usage (collections/config)
- DB queries
- business rules
- heavy transforms
- orchestration logic

---

### Migration Strategy (Batched) — ALL batches included (restored)

#### Batch 1 — API Routes (Highest ROI)

Targets:

- `src/app/api/oauth/**`
- `src/app/api/agent/**`
- `src/app/api/exercises/**`
- `src/app/api/pdfjs-viewer/**`

Action pattern:

- extract logic to `src/server/services/*`
- route becomes: validate input → call service → return response

Verify:

- `pnpm verify`
- smoke: affected endpoints respond

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- 0 direct Payload/DB/business logic in targeted API routes
- `pnpm verify` passes
- smoke endpoints OK

STOP → request operator approval (after Batch 1 completion).

#### Batch 2 — Heavy Frontend Pages

Targets:

- course pages
- study pages
- exercise pages
- chat-related pages

Action pattern:

- move data fetching logic to `server/services`
- page file only: read params → call service → pass result to `ui/web/*`

Verify:

- `pnpm verify`
- smoke: student flow works

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- pages read like glue (no heavy logic)
- `pnpm verify` passes
- student smoke flow OK

STOP → request operator approval (after Batch 2 completion).

#### Batch 3 — Server Actions (if any)

Action pattern:

- server action becomes a wrapper
- real logic lives in `server/services`

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- 0 “real logic” remains in server actions; wrappers only
- `pnpm verify` passes

STOP → request operator approval (after Batch 3 completion).

---

## Stage 6 — Consolidate Server Logic into `src/server/services` and `src/server/repos`

**Objective:** Separate “Payload framework” from “business logic”.

Move candidates (from your plan):

- `src/services/api` → likely `src/server/services/api` (if server-only)
- Any DB/Payload access currently in `src/lib/services` or `src/lib/queries`:
  - go to `server/repos` if it’s data access
  - go to `server/services` if it’s orchestration/decisions

Rules (added clarity):

- `repos` = data access (Payload/DB/HTTP), no UI concerns
- `services` = orchestration + decisions + use-cases
- No `client/ui` imports inside `server`

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- 0 imports from `server` into `client` or `ui`
- 0 imports from `client/ui` into `server`
- `pnpm verify` passes

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Stage 7 — UI Migration: move `src/components/**` into `src/ui/web` and `src/ui/admin`

**Objective:** Make UI location explicit without rewriting components.

Move candidates (from your plan):
Student UI heavy modules:

- `src/components/ExerciseRenderer/**` → `src/ui/web/exercise-renderer/**`
- `src/components/Media/**` → `src/ui/web/media/**`
- `src/components/chat/**` → `src/ui/web/chat/**` (unless truly used by admin too)

Admin-only:

- `src/components/admin/**` → `src/ui/admin/**`

Guardrails:

- No server imports inside UI (`ui/**` must not import `server/**`)
- Temporary exceptions allowed only if explicitly listed and must be removed before Part 2 enforcement

Exit Criteria (numeric):

- Student pages render (at least one main student page smoke test)
- `pnpm verify` passes
- 0 imports referencing `src/components/**` old paths

STOP → request operator approval.

---

## Output Artifacts (Added)

After each stage, the agent must output:

- Stage Report (moved list + verify logs summary + smoke results)
- “Temporary Exceptions List” (must be empty or explicitly enumerated)

---
